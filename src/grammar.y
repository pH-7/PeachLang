# Here is the Operator Precedence Table. As presented before, it tells the parser in
# which order to parse expressions containing operators.
# This table is based on the [C and C++ Operator Precedence Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B#Operator_precedence).

# In the following `rule` section, we define the parsing rules.
# All rules are declared using the following format:
#
#     RuleName:
#       OtherRule TOKEN AnotherRule    { result = Node.new }
#     | OtherRule                      { ... }
#     ;
#
# In the action section (inside the `{...}` on the right), you can do the following:
#
# * Assign to `result` the value returned by the rule, usually a node for the AST.
# * Use `val[index of expression]` to get the `result` of a matched
#   expressions on the left.
rule
  # First, parsers are dumb, we need to explicitly tell it how to handle empty
  # programs. This is what the first rule does. Note that everything between `/* ... */` is
  # a comment.
  Program:
    /* nothing */                      { result = Nodes.new([]) }
  | Expressions                        { result = val[0] }
  ;

  # Next, we define what a list of expressions is. Simply put, it's series of expressions separated by a
  # terminator (a new line or `;` as defined later). But once again, we need to explicitly
  # define how to handle trailing and orphans line breaks (the last two lines).
  #
  # One very powerful trick we'll use to define variable rules like this one
  # (rules which can match any number of tokens) is *left-recursion*. Which means we reference
  # the rule itself, directly or indirectly, on the left side **only**. This is true for the current
  # type of parser we're using (LR). For other types of parsers like ANTLR (LL), it's the opposite,
  # you can only use right-recursion.
  #
  # As you'll see bellow, the `Expressions` rule references `Expressions` itself.
  # In other words, a list of expressions can be another list of expressions followed by
  # another expression.
  Expressions:
    Expression                         { result = Nodes.new(val) }
  | Expressions Terminator Expression  { result = val[0] << val[2] }
  | Expressions Terminator             { result = val[0] }
  | Terminator                         { result = Nodes.new([]) }
  ;

  # Every type of expression supported by our language is defined here.

  | GetConstant
  | SetConstant
  | GetLocal
  | SetLocal
  | FUNCTION
  | Class
  | If
  | '(' Expression ')'    { result = val[1] }
  ;

  # Notice how we implement support for parentheses using the previous rule.
  # `'(' Expression ')'` will force the parsing of `Expression` in its
  # entirety first. Parentheses will then be discarded leaving only the fully parsed expression.
  #
  # Terminators are tokens that can terminate an expression.
  # When using tokens to define rules, we simply reference them by their type which we defined in
  # the lexer.
  Terminator:
    NEWLINE
  | ";"
  ;

  # Literals are the hard-coded values inside the program. If you want to add support
  # for other literal types, such as arrays or hashes, this it where you'd do it.
  Literal:
    NUMBER                        { result = NumberNode.new(val[0]) }
  | STRING                        { result = StringNode.new(val[0]) }
  | TRUE                          { result = TrueNode.new }
  | FALSE                         { result = FalseNode.new }
  | NULL                          { result = NullNode.new }
  ;

  # Method calls can take three forms:
  #
  # * Without a receiver (`self` is assumed): `method(arguments)`.
  # * With a receiver: `receiver.method(arguments)`.
  # * And a hint of syntactic sugar so that we can drop
  #   the `()` if no arguments are given: `receiver.method`.
  #
  # Each one of those is handled by the following rule.

  # In our language, like in Ruby, operators are converted to method calls.
  # So `1 + 2` will be converted to `1.+(2)`.
  # `1` is the receiver of the `+` method call, passing `2`
  # as an argument.

  # Our language uses indentation to separate blocks of code. But the lexer took care of all
  # that complexity for us and wrapped all blocks in `INDENT ... DEDENT`. A block
  # is simply an increment in indentation followed by some code and closing with an equivalent
  # decrement in indentation.
