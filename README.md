# PeachLang
PeachLang is a simple interpreted language done with Ruby using Racc (the Ruby version of Yacc/Bison). The language has been made thanks to [MACournoyer's book](http://01script.com/comment-creer-son-langage-de-programmation/).

Although my favorite book (my bedside book :D) is by far the [Dragon Book](https://www.amazon.ca/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811), Marc-AndrÃ©'s book is really cool as well.


## Usage

From your terminal, you can execute the example peach file:

```bash
ruby code/PeachLang examples/PeachLang/say-hello.peach
```

Or... use the interactive shell, like

```bash
PeachLang Interpreter
CTRL+R to quit
>> say("Hi")
Hi
=> nil
```
