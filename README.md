# PeachLang
PeachLang is a simple interpreted language done with Ruby using Racc (the Ruby version of Yacc/Bison). The language has been made thanks MACournoyer's book http://01script.com/comment-creer-son-langage-de-programmation/


## Usage

From your terminal, you can execute the example peach file:

```bash
ruby code/PeachLang examples/PeachLang/say-hello.peach
```

Or... use the interactive shell, like

```bash
PeachLang Interpreter
CTRL+R to quit
>> say("Hi")
Hi
=> nil
```
