# PeachLang (Programming Language)

**PeachLang** is a simple interpreted language done with Ruby using Racc for the parser (Racc is the Ruby version of Yacc/Bison). The language has been made thanks to [MACournoyer's book](http://01script.com/comment-creer-son-langage-de-programmation/).

Although my favorite book (my bedside book! :D) is by far the [Dragon Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools), Marc-AndrÃ©'s book is really cool as well :-)


## Usage

From your terminal, you can execute the example peach file:

```bash
ruby src/PeachLang examples/PeachLang/say-hello.peach
```

Or... use the interactive shell, like

```bash
PeachLang Interpreter
CTRL+R to quit
>> say("Hi")
Hi
=> nil
```


## Modify "grammar.y"

If you change `grammar.y` parsing rules, you will need to regenerate `parser.rb` file by using the following command:
```bash
racc -o parser.rb grammar.y
```

P.S. You will need to install Racc before doing it:
```bash
gem install racc
```
